# Container image + dependency vulnerability scanning with Trivy
# (https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) — the most widely used open-source
# scanner for both, so one tool covers container security scan and
# dependency (SCA) scan.
#
# 15.09.2026: moved here from the monorepo (`vodafonepaycomtr/scripts/`),
# which used to hold a cross-repo version reading both this repo and
# `../clover`. That monorepo is no longer in active scope (see AGENTS.md) —
# each repo now owns its own single-target copy of this script.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/trivy-scan.sh images   # scan the built Docker image
#   scripts/trivy-scan.sh deps     # scan package-lock.json as an
#                                   # independent second opinion alongside `npm audit`
#   scripts/trivy-scan.sh all      # both (default)
#
# Image must already be built (`docker compose up --build`) before running
# the `images` scan. Exits non-zero if any vulnerability is found — same
# policy as scripts/sonar-scan.sh: fix before commit/push, especially after
# changing the Dockerfile or a dependency.
