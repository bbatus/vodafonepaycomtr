/**
 * The slug an editor gives a Pages document to take over the homepage.
 * Publishing a page at this slug makes `/` render THAT page's blocks instead
 * of the composition below — the RFP's "every page manageable from the CMS"
 * asked for the homepage too, and it was the one page still assembled in code.
 *
 * Kept as an opt-in rather than a migration: the hardcoded composition stays
 * as the fallback, so the homepage cannot break just because the CMS is
 * unreachable or the page is unpublished. Delete the Pages document and `/`
 * goes straight back to the code path.
 *
 * `/` never reaches the [...slug] catch-all (Next resolves this static route
 * first), so the page has to be read here explicitly.
