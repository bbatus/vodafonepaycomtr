/**
 * RFP feedback 5.2 — "anında bakiye seçtim, sadece o kategorinin kampanyaları
 * gözükmeli, favoriler kısmı olmamalı".
 *
 * The old version took two PRE-SPLIT arrays (`favorites` = featured,
 * `allCampaigns` = everything else) and filtered each separately. That
 * carried a second bug on top of the reported one: because a featured
 * campaign only ever existed in the `favorites` array, simply dropping the
 * favourites block on a category filter would have made those campaigns
 * vanish from the page entirely. So this takes ONE list and derives both
 * views from it — a campaign can never be in neither.
 *
 * - "Tümü": unchanged — featured campaigns on top under "Bu ayın favorileri",
 *   the rest below. This is the behaviour the user confirmed as correct.
 * - A specific category: one single grid with every campaign in that
 *   category, featured or not, headed by the category's own name.
